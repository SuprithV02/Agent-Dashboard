🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

Docker & Docker Compose
Node.js (if running locally without Docker)

Running with Docker (Recommended)

  Clone the repository and spin up both services with a single command:
  1. bashgit clone https://github.com/SuprithV02/Agent-Dashboard.git
  2. cd Agent-Dashboard
  3. docker-compose up --build
  
This will start both the backend agent service and the frontend dashboard.
